# Online Algorithm Container Platform for Intelligent Welding

This project is an online algorithm container platform designed for intelligent welding, welding process optimization, and other production scenarios that utilize laser point clouds as data sources.

## Overview
The platform enables online simulation of point cloud processing, accumulation of algorithms, combination of experimental algorithms, and reduction of operating costs for robotic arms.

## Technical Roadmap
- **Backend Algorithm Container**: Developed using the C++ language.
- **Web Frontend**: Utilizes VUE and Three.js for 3D visualization.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Frontend and backend communication is facilitated by WebSocket.
- **Algorithm Container Features**: Supports various process structures such as sequence, branch, and loop to cater to complex experimental needs.

## Solutions
### Welding Process Monitoring and Tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitors the welding process in real time.
- **Precise Tracking**: Accurately tracks the weld position and shape.
- **Defect Detection**: Detects welding defects promptly to enhance welding quality and efficiency.

### Welding Process Optimization
- **Depth Map Analysis**: Optimizes welding process parameters through depth map analysis.
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Adjusts parameters to reduce waste and improve production efficiency.

### Intelligent Welding Solution
- **Machine Vision**: Applies machine vision and intelligent algorithms to the welding process.
- **Automation & Control**: Achieves automation and intelligent control to reduce labor costs and enhance production efficiency.

## Performance
- **Real-time Data Transmission**: The platform reads the memory of the C++ server and sends point cloud data for real-time transmission.
- **Rendering Speed**: The frontend can render point cloud computing results in milliseconds.
- **Hardware Performance**: The maximum number of point clouds rendered depends on the GPU hardware performance of the browser, using WebGL technology.
- **Example Hardware**: A Thinkpad T590 (low-voltage 8th generation I7, no dedicated graphics) can smoothly render 6 million point clouds.

## Free Trial and Deployment
- **Free Trial**: We offer a 14-day free trial for those interested in the project.
- **Remote Deployment and Debugging**: Free remote deployment and debugging services are provided.
